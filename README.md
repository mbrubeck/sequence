Sequence
========

> Plugin based web framework with message passing.

## Overview

Sequence is in alpha right now and is not really stable. It is mostly being used to power websites operated by Element Town.

## Code Style

Sequence is indented with 2 spaces and wraps after the 136th column for all code files. All files must end with a newline.

Why spaces? GitHub uses 8 spaces per tab in code previews which would cause code to show up differently.
  
Why 136 columns? GitHub code preview is sized to fit almost exactly 136 characters in width.
